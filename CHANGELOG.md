    ```js
    let transaction;
    try {
      transaction = await BookModel.begin({
        isolationLevel: BookModel.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.REPEATABLE_READ,
        type: BookModel.Transaction.TYPES.DEFERRED,
      });
      const book = await BookModel.findOne({where: {id: 1}}, {transaction});
      book.title = 'When Im Gone';
      await book.save({transaction});
      await transaction.commit();

      // Load updated data.
      await book.reload();
    } catch (error) {
      if (transaction)
        await transaction.rollback();
    }
    ```

## [1.0.12] - 2021/11/16
### Added
- Added a method to the model that can execute raw SQL. As there are often use cases in which it is just easier to execute raw / already prepared SQL queries, you can use the Model.query method.  
    ```js
    // By default the function will return two arguments - a results array, and an object containing metadata (such as amount of affected rows, etc).
    // Note that since this is a raw query, the metadata are dialect specific.
    const [results, metadata] = await BookModel.query("UPDATE book SET title = 'When Im Gone' WHERE id = 1");

    // In cases where you don't need to access the metadata you can pass in a query type to tell sequelize how to format the results. For example, for a simple select query you could do:
    // We didn't need to destructure the result here - the results were returned directly
    const users = await BookModel.query("SELECT * FROM book", {type: BookModel.QueryTypes.SELECT});
    ```

## [1.0.11] - 2021/11/10
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that the database config was read before NODE_ENV was set and the database config matching NODE_ENV could not be read.

## [1.0.10] - 2021/10/19
### Changed
- Added face similarity found to face search results in collection.

## [1.0.9] - 2021/10/13

    ```js
    // For example, when the current URL is "https://example.com/docs/api?q=value", "/docs/api" is set for "app.locals.currentPath".
    console.log(app.locals.currentPath);
    ```
